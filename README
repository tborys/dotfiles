Note: gitignore_global no longer displays properly in the GitHub file preview
window after I added two literal carriage return characters to the OS X 'Icon'
rule, so that git will correctly ignore OS X generated 'Icon' files that end in
a literal carriage return character (although they can deceptively appear as
'Icon?', they are actually 'Icon\r'). You can check out this blog post for more
information:
